# Homebrew formula template for the sidestep RELEASE-CANDIDATE channel.
# Updated by .github/workflows/rc.yml on every merge to main, which cuts
# an automatic v<version>-rc.N tag. Installs as `sidestep-rc` so alpha,
# rc, and stable coexist. macOS only (arm64).

      Release-candidate channel: cut automatically as v<version>-rc.N on

      Bootstrap a token (recommended — uses macOS Keychain):

        sidestep-rc auth login --token <bearer-token>
        sidestep-rc auth status
    EOS
  end

  test do
    assert_match "sidestep", shell_output("#{bin}/sidestep-rc --version 2>&1")
